## Overview
The Phishing Detection Framework provides an easy-to-use Python library for detecting phishing attempts in URLs and email messages. It leverages state-of-the-art machine learning models from Hugging Face to ensure high accuracy and reliability.

### Key Features
- **Dual Detection Modes**: Supports both URL and email phishing detection.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Uses advanced models for performance:
  - [`bert-finetuned-phishing`](https://huggingface.co/ealvaradob/bert-finetuned-phishing)
  - [`phishing-email-detection-distilbert_v2.4.1`](https://huggingface.co/cybersectony/phishing-email-detection-distilbert_v2.4.1)
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple inputs efficiently.
- **Developer Friendly**: Flexible API for seamless integration and customization.
- **Open-Source**: Built for developers by developers.
